# NeuroCLI
Agentic CLI Tool

This project, **NeuroCLI**, aims to be a sophisticated, **local command-line application** built entirely in **Python**, using the **Textual library** to create a rich Terminal User Interface (TUI).

Its core purpose is to provide an intuitive and efficient way for you to interact with AI models like **OpenAI's GPT and Google's Gemini** directly from your terminal. You'll be able to:

1.  Send prompts to these AI models.
2.  Receive generated code or text back.
3.  Seamlessly save this output to **new local files** or integrate it into **existing local files**.

Key features planned include:

* An **interactive TUI** guiding you through operations.
* Support for **creating new files** or **updating existing ones** (initially by replacing content or appending, with more granular updates later).
* **Diff previews** before any file modifications are made to ensure you're in control.
* Secure management of your API keys via a local `.env` file.

A significant future enhancement we've discussed is an **"AI Peer Review"** feature, where you could optionally have the output from one AI model reviewed and potentially improved by another AI model before you save it.

The project will use Python's built-in `venv` for virtual environment management and `pip` for installing dependencies listed in a `pyproject.toml` file. Version control will be handled with Git, and the project will be set up with a GitHub repository.

Essentially, NeuroCLI is designed to be your **intelligent assistant** for bridging AI code generation with your local development workflow, all within a polished terminal experience.

While it is a commandâ€‘line tool, NeuroCLI should still **look great** and carry its own visual flair, setting it apart from other CLIs.
